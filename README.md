Some experiments with SMT solvers and GIMPLE IR

# Installing
### gcc-python-plugin
`pysmtgcc` needs a special version of the [`gcc-python-plugin`](https://github.com/davidmalcolm/gcc-python-plugin) that adds some APIs not supported in the original. The version is available in the [`pysmtgcc` branch](https://github.com/kristerw/gcc-python-plugin/tree/pysmtgcc) in my fork of `gcc-python-plugin`.

When building, you need to specify the compiler that will use the plugin. I'm typically using the development version of GCC installed in `/scratch/gcc-trunk/install`, so I fetch, build, and install the python plugin as
```
git checkout -b pysmtgcc https://github.com/kristerw/gcc-python-plugin
cd gcc-python-plugin
make CC=/scratch/gcc-trunk/install/bin/gcc
make CC=/scratch/gcc-trunk/install/bin/gcc install
```
**Note**: There is a problem in Python 3.8 and most versions of 3.9 that makes the plugin fail with an error message that `gcc.WrapperMeta` is not iterable. If you get that error, you'll need to update to Python 3.9.13 or 3.10.

### Z3
You also need the [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) SMT solver and its Python bindings. The easiest way to install all of this is
```
pip3 install z3-solver
```

### pysmtgcc
The source code for `pysmtgcc` is available in this repository. No compilation is necessary â€“ `plugin1.py` or `plugin2.py` is passed to GCC using a command line argument (see below).

# Using plugin1.py

# Using plugin2.py
TBD
